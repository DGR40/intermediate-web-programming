# intermediate-web-programming-final-project 
This is my final project for my intermediate web programming and design course. I coded a functional movie theatre website using HTML, CSS, and PHP. 
Through an iterative design process I created a site that allows users to browse for movie showings, search for certain titles, search for movies in a given location, and search for movies
of a certain genre. Also, the site supports an admin login to edit the database and add, delete, or edit movie entries.
