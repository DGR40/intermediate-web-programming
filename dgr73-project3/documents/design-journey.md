# Project 3: Design Journey

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in Markdown Preview.** If it's not visible in Markdown Preview, then we won't grade it. We won't give you partial credit either. This is your warning.


## Design Plan

### Project 1 or 2
> Do you plan to reuse your Project 1 or 2 site?
> Which project?

No

> If yes, please include sketches of the site's current design (you may copy the "final" sections from those assignments.)


### Describe your Media Catalog (Milestone 1)
> What will your collection be about?
> What type of media will your site display? (images, videos, audio)

My collection will be all about movies being shown in all 3 of the fictitious Galaxy Movie Theatres in Rochester NY. The media it will display will be the image of the poster for the movie.

### Audiences (Milestone 1)
> Briefly explain your site's audiences. Be specific and justify why each audience is appropriate for your site.
> You are required to have **two** audiences: "information consumers" and "site administrators"

Information Consumer: The consumers of this site will be movie-goers who want to figure out what movie they would like to watch next at one of the Galaxy Theatres locations. They are appropriate for the site because they will be the people who are motivated to browse movies being shown at Galaxy Theatres as well as look at reviews and compare movies to see which movie will be best meet their wants.

Site Administrator: The site admin will be the owner of all three Galaxy Theatre movies. Because they want customers to come to their theatres, they have incentive to operate a site that is very reliable, easy to use, has truthful information regarding each movie, and shows the movie in its best light. They are appropriate for this site because new movies are constantly coming out and so it is imperative that the catalog stays up to date so that users have a great understanding and exposure to the movies that are out there in Galaxy Theatres.


### Personas (Milestone 1)
> Your personas must have a name and a "depiction". This can be a photo of a face or a drawing, etc.
> There is no required format for the persona.
> You may type out the persona below with bullet points or include an image of the persona. Just make sure it's easy to read the persona when previewing markdown.
> Your personas should focus on the goals, obstacles, and factors that influence behavior of each audience.

> Persona for your "consumer" audience:

Consumer: Jeff Smith

![](jeff-smith.png)

Description:
- Jeff is a 50 year old chef who loves movies. When he gets off work, his favorite thing to do is relax and go see a movie in the theatres.

Goals:
- Jeff wants to know exactly what new movies are available at his local chain theatres of "Galaxy Theatres".
- Jeff wants to know what movies have good or bad rankings.
- Jeff wants to see movies broken down by genre so he can pick out of a specific genre if he is feeling like seeing.

Obstacles:
- Jeff struggles to find a place online where all movies available at the various "Galaxy Theatres" are shown.
- Jeff also wants to easily view the movies by genre. Right now he has no easy way of seeing just "Drama" movies at these theatres for example.

Factors:
- Jeff's love for movies
- Jeff's desire to watch really good movies at Galaxy Theatres

> Persona for your "administrator" audience:

Admin: Johnny Lewis
![](jlew.png)

Description:
- Johnny is a movie connisseur who is also very organized and responsible. He likes keeping records of everything he does, including the movies he watches.

Goals:
- Johnny wants a way to keep track of all the movies that are out there.
- Johnny wants to be able to add new movies to his list as they come out
- Johnny wants to be able to manage the database through the web browser, not coding.

Obstacles:
- Johnny does not know how to code, so he needs a site that makes it very easy to manage the database of movies using just buttons and forms.

Factors:
- Johnny loves movies
- Johnny values honesty so he wants the correct information on the site
- Johnny likes using web programs rather than having to learn to code

NEW REVISED ADMIN:

Admin: Manu Hersk
![](manu.png)

Description:
- Manu is the owner of a very successful chain of movie theatres in the Rochester Area. He wants to give his theatres an online presence so patrons can see what movies are playing and where they are playing and information regarding that movie.

Goals:
- Generate the most costumers
- Have a website that is easily maintainable
- Have a website that does not involve him learning to code

Obstacles:
- Manu does not know how to code so he needs a site that makes it very easy to manage the database of movies that Galaxy Theatres are currently showing

Factors:
  - Manu uses Galaxy Theatres as his sole stream of revenue
  - Manu wants his clients to know he exists online
  - Manu wants to attract as many customers as possible

### Site Design (Milestone 1)
> Document your _entire_ design process. **We want to see iteration!**
> Show us the evolution of your design from your first idea (sketch) to the final design you plan to implement (sketch).
> Show us the process you used to organize content and plan the navigation, if applicable (card sorting).
> Plan your URLs for the site.
> Provide a brief explanation _underneath_ each design artifact. Explain what the artifact is, how it meets the goals of your personas (**refer to your personas by name**).
> Clearly label the final design.

Design 1:
 ![](d1.png)

This design shows the general layout of the page. The site will be one page and have a central content area that shows the movies in a list like fashion so it is easy for Johnny and Jeff's eyes to follow.

Design 2:
 ![](d2.png)

This design adds on the image thumbnail of the movie poster to each movie entry and adds the genre tag to each entry. Also, I took out the description from each row because I thought that would crowd the entry. Overall, these changes will make it easier for Johnny and Jeff to easily see what movies are on the site and what genre each movie is.

Design 3:
 ![](d3.png)

This designs explores instead of using the row-like layout, a more grid-like layout and each movie entry is represented in card form. This design should be more familiar to Jeff and Johnny (as it emulates classic sites such as instagram) and in turn they will feel more comfortable using and navigating the site. This design also puts the genre of the movie on the top of the card so Johnny and Jeff can quickly and easily see it. It also removes the reviews because they would clutter the card and make the card harder to understand for Johnny and Jeff.

Design 4:
![](d4.png)

This design adds the log in form to the top of the page and it adds the tags filters to the side of the grid and the tags onto the side of the cards and it adds a form that Johnny can fill out once logged in to add an entry to the db. This way Johnny can easily log in and add entries and both Johnny and Jeff can use the tags to find movies that meet the same requirements as the given tag. This overall makes the usability better and the site easier to manage and search through.

Design 5:
![](d5.png)

This design hides the log in form in the top of the page because only the admin Manu will be logging in and so the rest of the users need not see it all the time. Also, this design moves the search and tags onto a bar right below the navbar to make it easier to access. It also makes the design simpler and easier on the users eyes. This design also redesigns the cards and makes them simpler. The cards now just contain the poster of the movie, its title, its genre, and its rating. Also, I added a page called "Theatres" and a nav bar. The theatres page will have listed all three of the locations of Galaxy theatres in the rochester area in card like form just like the movies.

Design 6:
 ![](d6.png)

This design adds a view of all the tags that may be on the movie entries. They are clearly displayed right below the nav bar so Jeff and Manu can both easily see them and click them to view only entries of a particular tag.

Design 7:
 ![](d7.png)

FINAL
This is the design for the theatres page. It is very similar to the movies page but the theatre cards are larger to better dusplay what the theatre looks like to Jeff. These cards also include the address of the individual theatre so that Jeff can easily navigate to the theatres.

Design 8:
![](d8.png)

This is what the movies page looks like once Manu logs in. It shows the movies as normal, but also shows this form to add a new movie entry below the rest of the movies. This will allow Manu to add in new entries without having to hard code or access a database directly. Instead, it all happens through the website and the website handles all the backend. Also, when Manu is signed in the log in form disappears and begins a sign out button in the left corner for easy access.

Design 9:
![](d9.png)

This is what the page will look like when Manu is fully logged in. It will show all the tags and it will have a input and button with which Manu can add a new tag easily. Also, it will have a large add new movie form on top of all of the movie cards. I chose to do this because I thought Manu would rather have this form at the top of the page so it is easier to access. The form is the same as in the last drawing, only this time the elements all all in one line and more centered. This is to make it more pleasing to the eye and easier to use.

Design 10:
![](d10.png)

This is what the page will look like when Manu submits an incomplete add new movie form. This shows what the feedback would look like for the first few fields. Feedback like this will also be shown for the fields follwing summary such as rating, location, file upload, file upload url, and file source. This way, Manu can make sure that the info he is entering is valid and his customers can get reliable movie information.

Design 11:
 ![](d11.png)

This is the feedback Manu will get when he successfully submits a new movie form. It says "You have successfully submitted a new movie". This same design will be used for when the user successfully submits a new tag as well, just the message will be "You have successfully submitted a new tag". Both messages will show up in the same place. These messages will give Manu feedback to see if the action he attempted actually worked. This just helps with the overall usability of the site. Also, beneath the success message the gallery of movies will render as usual

Design 12:
 ![](d12.png)

This is the first design of the individual movie page - the one Manu or Jeff will see once they click on a movie from the gallery. It features a larger version image of the movie and all the info related to the movie.

Design 13:
![](d13.png)

FINAL
This is the final version of the individual movie page of a non-admin. This design centralizes the information and picture and removes the clunky box border. This is more pleasing to the eye. Also, this design lays out the tags as buttons towards the bottom of the screen and these buttons will allow jeff and manu to click on them and then be brought to the gallery only showing movies of that given tag.

Design 14:
![](d14.png)

FINAL
This is the final version of the individual movie page of Manu when logged in. It is the same as the design above but adds a clickable edit button at the bottom of the movie info box.

Design 15:
![](d15.png)

FINAL
This is the final version of the edit form for an individual movie. This form is only accessible by Manu once he is logged in and clicks the edit button. With this form, any field can be edited and then the save button can be clicked to save the changes. Also, the tags shown on the edit page can be clicked in order to remove the clicked tag from the individual movie. Also, there is an input in which Manu can apply a tag that already exists to that given individual movie by typing in the name of a tag that already exists. Also, there is a delete button on the bottom of the page that will delete the individual movie from the database and delete any references to it in the movie_tags database. Once the delete button is triggered, the feedback page will show.

Design 16:
![](d16.png)

FINAL
This is the final feedback page when a movie is deleted by Manu. It simply has the header, a message, and the footer. The message reads "Successfully deleted movie. Click here to return home" and the "click here to return home" is a link to the homepage that Manu can easily click.

Design 17:
![](d17.png)

FINAL
This is a refined final homepage that now adds a bar that shows what tag is being applied to the movies the user (both Manu or Jeff) are viewing. I added this feature so that Jeff and Manu both can see what tag is being used to filter the results being shown. This makes the site a lot easier for users to understand. If there is no tag selected then the bar reads "Tag Applied: None". Above the new tag selected bar is the "add a new tag" bar because Manu is logged in. Below this tag selected bar will show all the movies that match the selected tag. The header of this design now embodies the login/sign out form, the Title Banner, and the navbar. The current state of this design is Manu is logged in and has clicked "tag 9". The movie cards have the same design as Design 18 below. There was not enough space to show the whole cards on this design.

Design 18:
![](d18.png)

FINAL
This is the refined final homepage that is the same as above except this is what Jeff would see when using the site not logged in as Manu and as just a guest, after he selects tag 7. Below the tag selected bar is just the movies that have the same tag as the tag selected (tag 7) and no add new tag bar is shown. The design of the movie cards on this page is the final design for all movie gallery cards on the home page.

Design 19:
![](d19.png)

FINAL
This is what the user will see if the page they requested doesn't exist. It has the normal header with the navbar and then the text "This Page Does Not Exist. Click here to return home", and the "Click Here to Return Home" is a link to the homepage.

Design 20:
![](d20.png)

FINAL
This is what the footer will look like. I forgot to draw it in all my sketches but it will just be locked to the bottom of the page and read "Copyright 2021 - Galaxy Theatres - Rochester, New York".
### Design Patterns (Milestone 1)
> Write a one paragraph reflection explaining how you used the design patterns in your site's design.

These designs implement very familiar patterns seen in most catalogs online. Because of these patterns the users will feel more comfortable visiting and maneuvering through the site. One pattern the site will use is that the movies will be displayed in a a grid-like pattern as thumbnails with the name and picture of the movie showing. The next pattern that the site will use is that once a thumbnail in the grid is clicked it will expand and show all the additional information associated with the entry. Also, the site will use tags that serve as filters for movie results. This is a very common design theme in many catalogs. These tags will be clickable to filter results, and will also appear on the individual page when users click on a given movie. Finally, the site will have login form on the top of the page so users who can login will know exactly where it is and can easily log in.

## Implementation Plan

### Requests (Milestone 1. Revise in Milestone 2)
> Identify and plan each request you will support in your design.
> List each request that you will need (e.g. view image details, view gallery, edit book, tag product, etc.)
> For each request, specify the request type (GET or POST), how you will initiate the request: (form or query string URL), and the HTTP parameters necessary for the request.

- Request: view movie details
  - Type: GET
  - URL: /movie?id=X
  - query string

  - Type: GET
  - URL: /?tag=X
  - form
  - Params: tag_id

- Request: log in
  - Type: POST
  - URL: /
  - form
  - Params: username, password

### Database Schema (Milestone 1. Revise in Milestone 2)
> Describe the structure of your database. You may use words or a picture. A bulleted list is probably the simplest way to do this. Make sure you include constraints for each field.

> Hint: You probably need a table for "entries", `tags`, `"entry"_tags` (stores relationship between entries and tags), and a `users` tables.

> Hint: For foreign keys, use the singular name of the table + _id. For example: `image_id` and `tag_id` for the `image_tags` (tags for each image) table.

Table: movies
- id: INT {NN, AI, U, PK}
- user_id INT {NN}
- movie_name: TEXT {NN}
- img_url TEXT
- rating: INT {NN}
- summary: TEXT {NN}
- genre: TEXT {NN}
- loc: TEXT {NN}
- file_name: TEXT {NN}
- file_ext: TEXT {NN}
- source: TEXT {NN}

Table: users
- id: INT {NN, PK, AI, U}
- name: TEXT {NN}
- username: TEXT {NN, U}
- password: TEXT {NN}

Table: sessions
- id: INT {NN, PK, AI, U}
- user_id: INT {NN}
- session: TEXT {NN, U}
- last_login: TEXT {NN}
- FOREIGN KEY(user_id) REFERENCES users(id)

Table: groups
- id: INT {NN, PK, AI, U}
- name: TEXT {NN, U}

Table: memberships
- id: INT {NN, PK, AI, U}
- group_id: INT {NN}
- user_id: INT {NN}
- FOREIGN KEY(group_id) REFERENCES groups(id)
- FOREIGN KEY(user_id) REFERENCES users(id)

Table: tags
- id: INT {NN, PK, AI, U}
- tag: TEXT {NN, U}

Table: movie_tags
- id: INT {NN, PK, AI, U}
- movie_id: INT {NN}
- tag_id: INT {NN}
- FOREIGN KEY(movie_id) REFERENCES movies(id)
- FOREIGN KEY(tag_id) REFERENCES tags(id)

### Database Query Plan (Milestone 1. Revise in Milestone 2)
> Plan your database queries. You may use natural language, pseudocode, or SQL.

1. Get movie record of given movie id

    ```
    "SELECT * FROM movies WHERE id = :id;"
    ```

2. Delete movie from movies

    ```
    "DELETE FROM movies WHERE (id = :movie_id)"
    ```

3. Delete movie from movie_tags

    ```
    "DELETE FROM movie_tags WHERE (movie_id = :movie_id)"
    ```

4. Get tag id of tag name

    ```
    "SELECT * FROM tags WHERE (tag = :tag)"
    ```

5. Delete tag from movie

    ```
    "DELETE FROM movie_tags WHERE (movie_tags.tag_id = :tag_id AND movie_tags.movie_id = :movie_id)"
    ```

6. Upload new movie

    ```
    "UPDATE movies SET movie_name = :movie_name, user_id = :user_id, summary = :summary, rating = :rating, img_url = :img_url, genre = :genre, loc = :loc  WHERE (id = :id);"
    ```

6. Assign new tag to a movie

    ```
    "INSERT INTO movie_tags (movie_id, tag_id) VALUES (:movie_id, :tag_id)"
    ```

7. Add a new tag to tags

    ```
    "INSERT INTO tags (tag) VALUES (:tag)"
    ```

8. Select all movies of a given tag
    ```
    "SELECT * FROM movies LEFT OUTER JOIN movie_tags ON movies.id = movie_tags.movie_id WHERE (movie_tags.tag_id = $tag_id)";
    ```

4.
### Code Planning (Milestone 1. Revise in Milestone 2)
> Plan any PHP code you'll need here using pseudocode.
> Use this space to plan out your form validation and assembling the SQL queries, etc.
> Tip: Break this up by pages. It makes it easier to plan.

## Submission

### Audience (Final Submission)
> Tell us how your final site meets the needs of the audiences. Be specific here. Tell us how you tailored your design, content, etc. to make your website usable for your personas. Refer to the personas by name.

For Jeff:

My site serves all the needs for Jeff. It shows him all the movies being shown at Galaxy Theatres at three different locations in Rochester, NY. He can preview all the movies by looking at their individual cards in the gallery. The gallery cards show the title, genre, and rating. Then, if Jeff wants to see more, he can click on any movie in the gallery and instantly see the movie's title, genre, summary, rating, showing location, and tags associated with the movie. This fulfills Jeff's desire to be well informed of the movies available at galaxy theatres. Moreover, if Jeff wants to see movies of a particular tag, he can click that tag from the tag bar that is conveniently located right below the navbar and see just the movies that have that tag. Furthermore, to make it very clear to Jeff, there is a bar beneath all the tags that show what tag is currently applied. Of these tags, included are location tags such as Brighton which can show movies only showing at a particular location. This makes it easy for Jeff to narrow down his movie options to one of the three locations of Galaxy Theatre. Also, there is a whole page dedicated to explaining the three theatres that Jeff can easily navigate to using the navbar. This page shows a picture of the theatre and includes its name and address so Jeff can easily drive to the given theatre. This site overall fulfills both his needs of wanting to know what movies are available at Galaxy Theatres and wanting to see the movies broken down by genre as genre is included within the tags on the site.

For Manu:

My site serves all of Manu's needs. This site allows him to view all of his movies across all three theatres, view movies specific to a given theatre, and view movies specific to a given tag. He can also easily log in to then have admin access to features such as add tag, add movie, edit movie, and delete movie. All these controls are very self explanatory and allow Manu to use just the frontend buttons to make changes to his overall database without ever having to worry about code, which is one thing that Manu would really like. Additionally, there is feedback once a new tag is successfully added, a new movie entry is successfully added, and a movie is deleted. This helps Manu see that the changes he made actually went through. Also, when he is adding a new movie, there is feedback all the way through if he is not entering valid information into one or more of the fields. This will help Manu make sure that the info he submits is reliable and that he can maintain trust with his patrons by publishing only valid information. One example of this validation is that if Manu tries to enter a name of a movie that already exists in the database, the submission will not go through and show feedback saying that the movie name is not valid. Also, when adding a new movie, if Manu enters a location of Galaxy Theatres that does not exist then he will see feedback saying "add a valid location". This stops Manu from adding a movie with a location that does match any existing Galaxy Theatres location. Another way the site helps Manu is that when he is assigning tags, he can only assign tags that already exist in the tag bar on the homepage. This will prevent him from assigning a tag that does not yet exist. If he does want to add a new tag, Manu can easily use the add tag button on the homepage to add a new tag.


### Additional Design Justifications (Final Submission)
> If you feel like you haven’t fully explained your design choices in the final submission, or you want to explain some functions in your site (e.g., if you feel like you make a special design choice which might not meet the final requirement), you can use the additional design justifications to justify your design choices. Remember, this is place for you to justify your design choices which you haven’t covered in the design journey. You don’t need to fill out this section if you think all design choices have been well explained in the design journey.

The one design choice that I feel I need to explain is the lack of form validation when editing a movie. Why did I validate the add a new movie form but not validate the edit a movie form? Well, I decided that when adding a new movie it is very important to Manu that he is super accurate and attentive and makes sure that his movie has reliable information. Because he is starting from scratch, the validation is essential when he is adding a new movie. In contrast, when Manu is editing, he is only making very small changes. Maybe updating the location, perhaps adding a tag, or updating a movie's rating. Because I anticipate all of Manu's edits to be small scale, I did not see a need for form validation while editing.


### Self-Reflection (Final Submission)
> Reflect on what you learned during this assignment. How have you improved from Project 1? What things did you have trouble with?

This assignment has taught me so much more than I could have anticipated. I have grown so much since Project 1. This has been the first project where I felt I had great control over my database and it's tables. I originally struggled with using multiple tables and foreign keys to relate the two, but once I figured it out, through trial and error, I saw the beauty in the interplay between tables. I now feel very confident using foreign keys to relate tables. I also think that through this project I got better at sql queries. Now I feel I can get exactly the results I want from my query in a more efficient way than before. I also got better at using OUTER JOIN statements and understand how they work at a deeper level. Also, in a more general sense, I think I got better at thinking about the user and their needs the whole project. This project I tried to always consider how the feature I was implemented would be used by the user and if it was straight forward enough. In the beginning, I struggled with making my user controls very obvious and easy to use, but through iteration and iteration, I think I ended up making a very user friendly site. Another thing that I learned about through this project was how to upload files. I now know how to add files to a given directory and delete files from a given directory using PHP.

### Grading: Mobile or Desktop (Final Submission)
> When we grade your final site, should we grade this with a mobile screen size or a desktop screen size?

Desktop Screen Size


### Grading: Step-by-Step Instructions (Final Submission)
> Write step-by-step instructions for the graders.
> The project if very hard to grade if we don't understand how your site works.
> For example, you must login before you can delete.
> For each set of instructions, assume the grader is starting from /

Viewing all entries:
